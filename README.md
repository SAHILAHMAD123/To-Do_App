## To-Do App

Welcome to the To-Do App! This is a simple, user-friendly web application to manage your daily tasks. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows you to add, check, and delete tasks efficiently. The app also uses localStorage to persist your tasks even after refreshing the browser.

**Features**

* **Add Tasks:** Add new tasks to your to-do list.
* **Check Tasks:** Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list by clicking the '×' button.
* **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in localStorage, so they remain even after closing or refreshing the browser.
